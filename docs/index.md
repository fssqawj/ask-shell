## Overview

Ask-Shell is an **AI-powered task automation agent** that goes beyond simple command generation. Unlike tools that only translate single queries into commands, Ask-Shell acts as an intelligent agent that can handle **multi-step tasks**, **learn from failures**, and **adapt its strategy** until your task is truly complete.

## What Makes Ask-Shell Special?

**Not Just a Command Generator - A True Task Automation Agent!**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔄 **Executes multi-step tasks** | from start to finish |
| 🧠 **Learns from failures** | and automatically retries |
| 💭 **Shows its thinking** | in real-time for transparency |
| ✅ **Doesn't stop** | until your task is complete |

## Why Ask-Shell?

### Task-Oriented, Not Command-Oriented

| Other Tools | Ask-Shell |
|------------|-----------|
| Generate ONE command → Done | Execute MULTIPLE steps → Analyze results → Adjust strategy → Complete task |
| "Here's your command, you run it" | "I'll keep working until the task is finished" |
| Fails? You figure it out | Fails? AI analyzes, retries, finds alternatives |
